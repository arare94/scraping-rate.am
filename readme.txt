Hello

To work with these files you need the Python 3.7 interpreter in your system.

At the first please install all requirement libraries in the "requirements.txt" file by typing "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt" or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

Don't execute these files via sublime text, because sometimes sublime text doesn't work correctly with the python's "input()" function. 

Thank's :)
